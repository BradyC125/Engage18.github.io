		<h1>Who We Are</h1>
		<p>Engage 18 is a registered 501(c)(3) in the state of Michigan, and is founded and run entirely by high school students. We're a nonpartisan group focused on engaging youth in politics and increasing youth voter turnout, in addition to giving young adults a platform for their voices to be heard. We pursue issues that are relevant to America's youth, and work to ensure elections are accessible to them through events like voting registration and candidate meet and greets.</p>
		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<p>Our mission is to encourage participation in government among young adults whose voices would otherwise not be heard. To that end, we host events that encourage involvement in politics, like voter registration drives and meet and greets with candidates, and help amplify the beliefs these young adults hold. We work to provide mentorship, resources, and opportunity to ensure young adults have everything they need to become an active member in our governmental process. It's often said that our children are our future, but at Engage 18 we believe that if we are to create the world they deserve, they must be our present as well. That's why the organization is founded and run entirely by high school students - we believe youth activism is the key to change, and we believe we can be the ones to encourage and provide it.</p>
		<h1>Our Stances</h1>
		<p>As established in the Engage 18 bylaws, postions can be taken on issues with a 2/3 vote of Engage 18's Board. So far, we've taken stances on the following issues. All views are meant to be reflective of those which are shared by young adults around the nation.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Gun Control</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We believe in the adoption of reasonable gun control measures, including universal background checks, modernization of our ATF, and the rights of schools to restrict gun possession on their properties. We believe that gun ownership should be exercised in a resposible way, and that the government should not sacrifice the security of the public by lessening these responsibilites. We therefore believe that every gun transfer, even one taking place between private actors, should be subject to a comprehensive background check, that states should operate on a 'may issue' basis rather than 'shall issue', and that training should be mandatory before a gun can be carried in any public place.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Environment</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We believe that we must protect our environment to safeguard our future. We accept the scientific reality that human action is a driving factor in climate change, and we believe that steps must be taken to curb our reliance on detrimental habits and energy sources. We oppose threats to our natural resources like Enbridge Line 5, and we support initiatives to help protect the Earth from dangerous effects of human action.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Net Neutrality</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our modern society is built on the free exchange of information, and no method is more efficient for these purposes than the internet. The internet permits people of all ages to learn and grow as individuals. It also provides endless information that we need in order to maintain an educated  population, both at the voting booth and in the wider world. Modern policies threaten the existence of a free and open internet, and impede on the free exchange of ideas. These factors would drastically decrease the ability of an individual to meaningfully connect with the world around them on a national or international scale, and would hamper the rise of activism which has to date been propogated by the internet. We oppose these policies, and support a readoption of Net Neutrality on an immediate basis.</p>
