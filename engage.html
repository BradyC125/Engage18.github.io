			<h1>Become Engaged</h1>
			<p>Our modern democracy depends on all of us to be engaged in our government. This page contains policy information, details on how you can take a stand, and how you can participate in or contribute to Engage 18.</p>
			<h1>Current Issues</h1>
			<p>There are many policy issues facing us, both on a national and state level. The information we've collected here can help you create an informed opinion on different policy issues facing us today, and enable you to better take a stand</p>
			<!-- Policy Stances
			<ul>
				<li>Gun Control</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The Supreme Court upheld in DC v. Heller that an individual right to bear arms exists, but also held that limitations could be instituted constitutionally. These limitations include but are not limited to requiring background checks, banning unusual or dangerous weaponry, and prohibiting weaponry in sensitive areas such as schools.</li>
						<li>The Dickey Amendment, passed by Congress in 1996, has continued to be upheld to this day. This bill effectively prevents the CDC from performing research on gun violence through a manipulation of the agency's funding.</li>
						<li>The National Tracing Center of the ATF is our nation's central hub for tracing weapons used to carry out crimes, but they've been deliberately impeded from performing their jobs efficiently. Chronically deprived of resources and space, prohibited from maintaining a searchable database, and understaffed to an outrageous extent, it is clear Congress is attempting to kill this agency through neglect.</li>
						<li>No standard exists for gun transfers on a national level. Instead, states are left the power to issue gun liscenses, with no established laws regulating how they ought to do this. This policy leads to inconsistency and poor implementation of logical regulations in many states</li>
						<li>In Michigan, there currently does not exist a requirement for a background check when a private individual sells a weapon such as a rifle or a shotgun. Additionally, there is no requirement for a liscense to open carry weaponry. This means an individual could, without a background check, legally purchase and carry a weapon in public</li>
						<li>A decision by the Michigan Supreme Court is pending which will decide whether schools can prohibit guns on their property. The case, Michigan Gun Owners Inc. v. Ann Arbor Public Schools, has been heard by the court, and a verdict should be issued soon. If Ann Arbor wins, schools will be able to control who may have a gun on their property. If they lose, guns will be universally permitted to be carried within schools by an adult. Engage 18 has submitted an amicus brief on this case arguing in favor of AAPS, which can be found <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Clerks/Documents/2017-2018/155196/155196_97_AC_E18.pdf">here</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Environmental Policy</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Scientific consensus holds that humans are responsible for climate change, thanks in large part to our emissions of greenhouse gasses.</li>
						<li>Our EPA is in dire straits, as the current head is an individual who has tried repeatedly to get rid of it altogether</li>
						<li>On Jan. 16 2018, it was reported that new solar resources were cheaper than existing coal resources. The very same day, the administration imposed new restrictions on the importation of solar panels, driving the price back up.</li>
						<li>The EPA is reportedly considering classifying acts such as burning wood carbon neutral, despite a carbon impact from both the deforestation and burning of the carbon based substance. This blatantly contradicts science.</li>
						<li>Instead of moving to protect our environment, the EPA is currently moving in the opposite direction, adopting actions that seek to reduce regulations and lessen the environmental responsibility required of companies.</li>
						<li>There is evidence to indicate that information regarding climate change is being whitewashed from our government's websites on a broad scale, part of what appears to be a campaign to misinform the public.</li>
						<li>In Michigan, we are particularly reliant on the waters of the Great Lakes. These precious resources are threatened in a variety of manners.</li>
						<li>Projects like Enbridge Line 5 threaten the Great Lakes, the largest freshwater source in the world. These have been plagued with issues, including damaged and dented pipes, ships which have struck the pipes with their anchors, and late inspections that have lead to 1.8 million USD in fines. These issues are clear indicators that disaster is likely to strike, something we must all avoid to conserve our natural resources.</li>
